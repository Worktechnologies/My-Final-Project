               <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">A responsive design</a> adapts the web-page layout to the viewing environmentby using<br> techniques such as fluid proportion-based grids,flexible images,and CSS3 media<br> queries, an extension of the @media rule, in the following ways:

            <div class="Highlightes2">
                <ul>
                    <li>The fluid grid concept calls for page element sizing to be in relative units like percentages, rather than absolute units like pixels or points</li>
                    <li>Flexible images are also sized in relative units, so as to prevent them from displaying outside their containing element.</li>
                    <li>Media queries allow the page to use different CSS style rules based on characteristics of the device the site is being displayed on, e.g. width of the rendering surface (browser window width or physical display size)</li>
